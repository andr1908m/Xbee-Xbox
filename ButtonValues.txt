The data for the buttons is a word, where the high byte has A,B,X,Y,LB,RB
				    and the low byte has the DPAD, Back, Start, LeftStick and RightStick
LB = 1
RB = 2
A = 16
B = 32
X = 64
Y = 128

DpadUp = 1
DpadDown = 2
DpadLeft = 4
DpadRight = 8

Start = 16
Back = 32

So when you make arduino code for this, grab this list and have if statements for when you receive Xbee/Serial information

//if (Serial.read() == 16)
// grab or something lol
